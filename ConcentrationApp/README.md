#  Stanford CS193p First Project - Concentration

This app is designed applying a simple MVC design pattern, where M(model) stands for data structures that make up this app, V(view) stands for UI, C(controller) stands for view controller. Only C(controller) can directly communicate to M(model) and V(view), and M(model) should be independent from V(view)
